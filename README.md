# 2.11BSD-Dr.Nim

The game of Dr. Nim implemented as a CGI application for BSD 2.11 running on the PiDP-11

The program is written to compile on the PiDP 11 running 2.11 BSD.

It was written as a proof-of-concept for an update to the 2.11BSD-httpd web server that passes request data to the CGI program via the command line.

Beyond installing the drnim_webcgi program in the /home/www/cgi-bin directory, the marble.png image is expected to be in the /home/www/images directory.
